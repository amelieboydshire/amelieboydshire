# ðŸ’« Hi, I'm AmÃ©lie:
During my Biology BSc, I developed an appreciation for the power of coding and its potential to revolutionise scientific research. <br><br>Since graduating, I have continued to explore its wider uses, with a particular interest in ethical applications of AI. Driven by my enthusiasm for continuous learning, I embarked on an intensive 13 week full-stack software engineering bootcamp with Bright Network Technology Academy. <br><br>This has enabled me to develop my proficiency in the integral programming languages, as well as to hone my soft skills. I am excited to combine my scientific background with my acquired programming skills to drive innovation and create impactful software.
